% Define the rules for recommending activities based on the weather

% Helper predicate to print the list of activities
write_activities([]).
write_activities([Activity|Rest]) :-
    write('- '), write(Activity), nl,

% Example query: recommend activities for a specific weather condition
% To use this, simply query recommend_activity with the weather condition
% For example: recommend_activity(sunny).

% Define dynamic predicates for student registration
:- dynamic enrolled/2.

% Register a student for a course
register(Student, Course) :-
    \+ enrolled(Student, Course),
    can_register(Student, Course),
    assert(enrolled(Student, Course)),

% Drop a course for a student
drop(Student, Course) :-
    retract(enrolled(Student, Course)),

% Check if a student can register for a course
can_register(Student, Course) :-

% Query current course enrolment for a student
current_enrolment(Student) :-

% Example usage:
% register(john, cs101).
% register(john, cs102).
% drop(john, cs102).
% register(john, cs201).
% current_enrolment(john).
